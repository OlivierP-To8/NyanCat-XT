                            * NyanCat for DOS *
                            *******************

After the Thomson TO8 release, here is the TO16 version of the famous NyanCat.
The Thomson TO16 is a French PC XT computer from the late eighties.

This software should work on any PC XT with a Plantronics CGA graphic card
or an EGA graphic card. 
A SoundBlaster is required for the sound playback. The BLASTER environment 
variable in AUTOEXEC.BAT must be set with the proper values.

You can change the following parameters :
    /fps:15 (with a value from 1 to 30)
    /dsp:201 (with an hexa value for the DSP version)
    /dma:4096 (with a value from 1 to 32768 for the dma buffer size)
    /wav:filename.wav (with the name of another WAV file)
If there's not enough conventional memory, XMS memory will be used if 
available.
